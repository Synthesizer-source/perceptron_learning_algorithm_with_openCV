# Perceptron Learning Algorithm With OpenCV
Classification example using the perceptron learning algorithm with the OpenCV library. 
This example, contains two different classes, ```CANNON``` and ```CELLPHONE```. There are a total of 100 images for training. The target value of the cannon class is 0, the target value of the cellphone class is 1. The bias value is 1. **Sigmoid** is used as activation function.
